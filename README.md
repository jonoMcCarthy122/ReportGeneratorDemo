# Report Generator Demo

## Introduction 📢

This is a basic minimal api demo project to show the power ✨ of object oriented programming we will make use of the 
 **Strategy** and **Factory** design patters and show you how to combine them to get an even more robust solution.

 In this demo we will be using the **Strategy** pattern to enforce the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) that will show 
 you how to extend your application to support endless number of report formatters.

We will also be using the **Factory** pattern that will use dependency injection to get the correct formatters based
off the report type yu provide.

this demo was inspired by the following post: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/admir-live_softwaredevelopment-csharp-dotnet-activity-7148231937411739648-h9R0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop
